 ### design excellent classes is a huge work
 Overloading, operators, memory control, distribution and objects define and delete may not belong to you.
Some basic problems should be considered before typing:

**1.** How are the new type objects created and deleted?
**2.** How are the object initialization and object value assignment?
**3.** If the object is pass-by-value, does it have special meaning?
**4.** What is the values limitations and restrictions of new type object?
**5.** The new object type should implement any father classes?
**6.** Is there casting?
**7.** Which functions and operators are resonable for this new type object?
**8.** Which basic function should be dismissed/tunred down? (set as private)
**9.** member functions and values scope? friend protected private public?
**10.** Which interfaces are the undeclared interfaces?
**11.** How general is the new type?
**12.   Does the new type really needed?**
