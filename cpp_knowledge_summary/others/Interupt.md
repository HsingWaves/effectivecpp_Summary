### 1. Interrupt = Hardware “Table Jump”

- An interrupt is not polling — it’s like a hardware-implemented jump table.
- When an interrupt signal arrives, the CPU doesn’t check in a loop; instead, logic gates instantly redirect control flow.
- Analogy: like a railway switch — if a signal is present, the track changes immediately.

------

### 2. 8088 External Interrupt Pins

- **Pin 17 (NMI):** Non-maskable interrupt (cannot be disabled).
- **Pin 18 (INTR):** Maskable interrupt (can be disabled via flags).
- When the CPU accepts an interrupt, it asserts a signal on **Pin 24 (INTA)** to acknowledge.

------

### 3. Internal Path

- Various interrupt sources (external NMI/INTR, internal faults like divide-by-zero, trap, etc.) feed into the **interrupt control logic**.
- The **instruction decoder** checks for interrupts after each instruction execution.
- If an interrupt is pending and enabled, instead of fetching the next sequential instruction, the CPU “jumps” to an internal interrupt instruction path.

------

### 4. Hardware Priority Logic

- Multiple interrupt sources are resolved by **priority circuits**:
  - Example: a chain of AND gates (A1–E1, A2–E2 …).
  - Higher-priority devices block lower-priority ones by preventing their signals from propagating.
- Only the highest-priority active interrupt gets acknowledged.
- Dedicated interrupt controllers (e.g., Intel 8259A) can manage priorities and provide the interrupt vector directly.

------

### 5. Response Flow

1. CPU finishes current instruction.
2. If an interrupt is present and allowed:
   - CPU asserts **INTA**.
   - External circuit provides either device ID or directly the interrupt vector.
3. CPU pushes current program counter & flags onto the stack.
4. CPU loads the interrupt vector and jumps to the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
5. After ISR finishes, an **IRET** instruction restores PC & flags to resume normal execution.

------

### 6. Key Point

- **No polling**: the CPU doesn’t loop to check interrupts.
- Instead, **combinational logic + priority circuits** instantly determine if/which interrupt should trigger.
- This makes interrupts extremely fast — detection and redirection can happen in a single instruction cycle.

A **step-by-step text flow (state diagram style)** of how the CPU handles an interrupt (taking the 8088 as example):

------

### **Interrupt Handling Flow**

**State 1: Normal Execution**

- CPU is fetching, decoding, and executing instructions in sequence.
- Program Counter (PC) points to the next instruction.

------

**State 2: Interrupt Request Arrives**

- An external device raises **NMI (pin 17)** or **INTR (pin 18)**.
- Internal faults (e.g., divide-by-zero, trap) can also generate interrupt requests.
- The **interrupt logic circuit** detects this at instruction boundary (no extra polling needed).

------

**State 3: Interrupt Acknowledge**

- CPU finishes the current instruction.
- If interrupts are enabled (IF flag = 1, unless NMI), CPU asserts **INTA (pin 24)**.
- External priority circuit or controller (e.g., 8259A) responds with an **interrupt vector number**.

------

**State 4: Save Current Context**

- CPU pushes the following onto the stack (user program’s stack):
  1. Flags register
  2. Code segment (CS)
  3. Instruction pointer (IP)
- This preserves the exact return point.

------

**State 5: Load ISR Address**

- CPU uses the interrupt vector number to index into the **Interrupt Vector Table** (IVT) in memory.
- Each entry in the IVT stores a 4-byte pointer (CS:IP) to the interrupt service routine (ISR).
- PC is loaded with this ISR address.

------

**State 6: Execute ISR**

- CPU starts fetching and executing instructions from the ISR.
- ISR handles the device/event (e.g., keyboard, timer, disk).

------

**State 7: Return from Interrupt**

- ISR ends with the **IRET instruction**.
- IRET pops **IP, CS, and Flags** from the stack.
- CPU restores execution state exactly where it left off.

------

### **Summary (State Flow)**

```
Normal Execution
   ↓
Interrupt Request Detected
   ↓
CPU Acknowledges (INTA) + Gets Vector
   ↓
Save Context (Flags, CS, IP → Stack)
   ↓
Load ISR Address from IVT
   ↓
Execute Interrupt Service Routine
   ↓
IRET → Restore Context
   ↓
Resume Normal Execution
```

## **Polling (Software Checking)**

1. **Normal execution:**
    CPU runs a loop checking each device register or memory-mapped flag.

2. **Polling check:**
    After (or before) each instruction / loop iteration, CPU executes:

   ```
   test device_status
   jz   loop   ; if not ready, keep looping
   ```

   This consumes CPU cycles **even when no device needs service**.

3. **Event occurs (e.g., key pressed):**
    Device sets a flag bit in its status register.

4. **CPU detects it:**
    On next polling iteration, CPU sees the flag is set.

5. **Handle event:**
    CPU branches to the service routine.

6. **Return:**
    After servicing, CPU resumes polling loop.

 **Problem:** CPU wastes time constantly checking devices → low efficiency.

------

##  **Interrupts (Hardware-Driven)**

1. **Normal execution:**
    CPU executes instructions of the main program without checking devices.
2. **Event occurs:**
    Device raises an **interrupt request (IRQ)** line.
3. **Interrupt detection:**
    At instruction boundary, CPU hardware interrupt logic notices the signal.
   - If enabled, CPU asserts **INTA** to acknowledge.
4. **Context save:**
    CPU automatically pushes **Flags, CS, IP** onto the stack.
5. **Jump to ISR:**
    CPU loads ISR address from Interrupt Vector Table and executes it.
6. **Handle event:**
    ISR deals with the device (e.g., read keyboard scancode).
7. **Return:**
    ISR executes `IRET`, restoring context. Main program continues **exactly where it left off**.

 **Advantage:** CPU spends **zero time checking devices**; response is immediate and efficient.

**Polling = software if-statement loop** → wastes cycles, slow response.

**Interrupts = hardware jump table** → instant detection, efficient, CPU only reacts when needed.
