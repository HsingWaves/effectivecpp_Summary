### Virtual function is for customizing for its derived classes
  If a class doesn't contain a virtual function, this class is not attempted to be as **base class**
  Not all base classes are designed for polymorphism, such as ** string **

### Attention 1: polymorphic base classes should declare a virtual deconstruction function. If class
### has any virtual functions, it should have virtual deconstruction fuction.
